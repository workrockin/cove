title: Travel phones for Maldives 
---

Planning a trip to Maldives? Hmmm lets see what we have here. A nation with more than 1190 coral islands scattered around in the Indian Ocean giving you all the space you need to replenish your soul, while at the same time making it possibly one of the best places on earth to go scuba diving, displaying the an indescribably beautiful underwater scenery that has the power to satiate the most insatiable of adventurers. 

We unhesitatingly admit that Maldives is a true paradise on earth. And we boldly proclaim that if you're going to Maldives you're in for a trip of lifetime.

However there's nothing like a preposterous international roaming charge to can ruin the fun of holidays. Its no reason to pout though as local prepaid data sim cards are available from the airport itself (dialing code +960) as well as other shops locally. It is highly advisable that you buy them as soon as you land. There sim card that come loaded with a data pack and talk time. The talk time however will cover only local calls so its better to use the internet data pack to send messages or to communicate with your friends and family back home.

Maldives has two choices when it comes to sim cards 
1.  Dhiraagu (plans https://www.dhiraagu.com.mv/dhiraagu_Prepaid.aspx)
2.  Ooredoo (plans https://www.ooredoo.mv/prepaid/)

A passport would suffice as an identity proof though some shop owners may request a visa, tickets and proof of stay. So keep them handy. 

Although both service providers have a good coverage all across (better in major cities as compared to remote islands ) if you are travelling in a group it may be a good idea to get a good mix of sim cards from both the providers just in case one network doesn't work.

**Anything else?** 

Well not really. Except some self promotion [2].  At Workrock we build special purpose travel phones  that work with international all SIM cards. All phones equipped with cameras so you can take most awesome selfies. The phone supports all common tasks including web browsing, listening to music, taking notes on the trip, finding location on google maps, reading emails, calling and messaging. You can use the phone as a hotspot to connect your other devices with internet. The phones can be locked so in case you loose your phone all your stuff remains encrypted. 

**What apps are installed?**

Only a handful of apps are installed to conserve battery and minimize the distraction.  You can take photos. Make videos. Listen to music. Set up hotspots. Access wifi bluetooth. But No Facebook, whats app etc. Sorry! You'll have plenty of time to do that when you reach home.  After all you want to enjoy your trip not stare at your phone all day long. No? 

The phones ship with charging adapters that can plug in type c [1] sockets that are quite popular in Maldives. Additionally the mobile phone charger operates between 100 volts and 240 volts covering voltage standards of all international locations. Any phone that you buy with workrock can work anywhere on the globe.  In Maldives or anywhere your fancy takes you.  

We work with a range of OEM manufacturers and we'll help you choose a phone that fits  your budget. **Our fees is 10% of the base price of the phone. Shipping charges are extra**. 

Drop us an email on workrockin@gmail.com with your budget and we'll send you a few recommendations. If you like it we'll ask for an advance, order the device, prepare it for your adventure, wrap it up nicely and then send it to you. After which you will take a selfie of your smiling face and post in on twitter telling all your friends how awesome we are. But don't linger for too long. You will be going to Maldives. And the bags, stubborn as they are, won't pack themselves.

**Before we take your leave, a word on imports in Maldives**

For native residents Maldives custom requires you to get approval for all radio communication devices that transmit power over 100 miliwatts.  Since the threshold is set so low it even includes [*] short range communication devices like wifi access points and yes even mobile phones. This is a precautionary step that is taken by many governments around the world. Generally though most of the common household electronic devices will be promptly approved by the customs so there is no reason to worry.
