            <p>
                Cove is a new kind of phone configured to meet the demands of the modern traveler. Each phone comes with a set of pre-installed apps that allow you to </p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                <li>Communicate. Call, send messages and emails</li>
                <li>Take photographs, listen to music and surf the internet</li>
                <li>Connect to wifi, turn your phone into a hotspot </li>
                </ol>
                
            </p>
            <p>
            And that is all. No continuous notifications from a dozen social media apps. No jumping around 10 IM services to reply to a dozens of messages. Your phone delivers a better performance. The battery lasts longer.  
            </p>
  <p>Cove separates your travel phone from your personal/work phone. You get the timeout you deserve while still enjoying the benefits of cutting edge technology. Cove is a phone that you can take along with you on your next trip confident in knowing that it will assist you when required but won't get in the way of fun.   </p>
  
            <p><h2 id="specs">THE SPECS</h2></p>
            <p>
               Each Cove phone is customized to suit the budget and requirements of the traveller. Each phone may have a different camera sharpness, a different storage capacity, different amount of RAM, a different processor, a different radio chip a different manufacturer. No two cove phones will be the same. And yet every cove phone will be at once familliar and usable by anyone  
               
            </p>
            <p>
            <ol>
            <li>Each phone will have an unlocked SIM slot. No matter where you travel in the world you'll be able to use a local prepaid sim card to enjoy internet and other calling facilities. Cove is working with its telecom partners across the world to make sure that you get best mobile experience possible.  
            </li>
            <li>
            Each phone will be able to connect to wifi hotspots around the world. All phone will support dual band frequencies giving you the ability to connect to both 2.4 and 5Ghz bands. The phone will have built in support for captive portals so in case you check into a hotel that requires you to use a token before you can access wifi cove will support that too. Additionally the phone will have rich radio communication features allowing it to be turned into a hotspot (with support across all SIM cards and telecom networks) use bluetooth as well as NFC. 
            </li>
            <li> Cove is a non intrusive smart phone. The last thing that you want when you are on a data diet somewhere on a remote island in <a href="https://workrockin.github.io/cove/2019/06/10/travel-maldives">Maldives</a> is an app that shows you 5 second of ads before it gets to the point. All cove applications are ad free. You won't even need to update them, if you don't want to. It will just work. As long as you like. Cove guarantees a consistent, offline and portable mobile computing experience.</li>
